## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Favorite Apps** - 
1. **TikTok**:

   - Ability to repost videos
   - TikTok shop
2. **Letterboxd**:

   - Personalization of profile showcasing favorite movies and movies recently watched
3. **Depop**:

   - Algorithm that recommends clothing based on your likes

**App Idea**:
College Dating - A college dating/socializing app is an app idea I would like to build. 
                 The app would help college students find new friends.
                 To use the app, you would have to attend a college which would be authorized 
                 with the required use of an edu email when signing up. Students would make profiles          
                 and, similar to dating apps, would be able to discover new people at their school. The app 
                 would allow the student to add their personal interests and match them with people with similar 
                 ones from their school. People would be able to follow and message people that they match with.
                 As a college student, I know the difficulty in making new friends when stepping onto campus 
                 and this app would make the process easier and build stronger communities at universities.
